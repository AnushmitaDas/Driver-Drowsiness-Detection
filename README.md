# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This a Python code using OpenCV and Dlib libraries to detect drowsiness and alert the driver if its detected.
The steps involved for the completion of this project include:
- Detection of Eye Landmarks
- Drowsiness detection based on Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) which is the ratio of the length of the eyes to the width of the eyes.
- Alert Driver (I have used sound of an alarm here as a alert tone)
